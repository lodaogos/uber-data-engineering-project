## Introduction

This is my personal project in order to further amplify my understanding towards data engineering. The tools that will be used on this project are Jupyter Notebook, GCP Storage, Python, Compute Instance, Mage AI, BigQuery, and Looker Studio.

## Dataset Used

We will use NYC TLC Trip Record dataset for this project. The dataset contains yellow and green taxi trip records which include fields that capture pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.

The dataset used for this project can be found here: https://github.com/lodaogos/uber-data-engineering-project/blob/main/data/uber_data.csv
